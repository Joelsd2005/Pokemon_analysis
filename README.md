# Pokemon_analysis

## About the project

This project will be about the information of different pokemon types, the moves they can learn, the level they evolve at and their base stats. All pokemon that are evolved will be included in this project since they will be the ones that have the best based stats. I will be looking at pokemon from all regions since the pokedex continues to increase when new pokemon are added.

I will seperate each pokemon into groups based on what type they are because it will save time from having to analyse each pokemon seperately. I will use the count function to count all of the pokemon in each type to see what pokemon type is the most popular. In this project I will also compare the base stats of each pokemon type so i can learn which pokemon type is the strongest. To do this I will use the average function because there are a different number of pokemon for each type so collecting the average is the best way to get accurate data to compare and which ever type has the highest average has the best stats. Once the average has been found, I will create another column for the average of each pokemon type so i can visualise it straight away without having to do the equation again

Analysis of pokemons moves are next and the way I will do this is by filtering the data so I can rearrange it to highest to lowest because it will show me the pokemon moves that does the most damage. I can use this to see which types have the best pokemon moves since i can use the average function again to find out which type can do the best damage overall. I will then analyse this in a bar chart for each of the types so people will clearly be able to see which pokemon types have the most damaging attacks.
